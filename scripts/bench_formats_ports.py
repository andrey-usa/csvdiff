"""The same comparison from CSV, JSON and Parquet, in every native port.

Two questions at once, which is why the table has two axes:

  * how the three ports compare on one input -- the question "can Rust and Zig
    match the C++ port" is asked here, on one host, in one sitting;
  * what the input format costs -- the same rows, the same key, the same
    per-cell diff, with only the container changing.

Every payload is written by this project's own generator (`rust/gen-data`), so
the three formats hold the same values spelled the same way; a conversion step
would otherwise be measuring the converter. Each format is generated, measured
and deleted in turn, because all three at ten million rows is about 15 GB.

Peak RSS and CPU time both come from `wait4`'s rusage for that exact child --
the kernel's own high-water mark rather than a poll that can miss a spike. These
engines map their inputs, so resident pages include the file; the `above` column
subtracts it, and for Parquet that number is the whole point, since the pages are
decoded into an arena and the mapping is given back.

The `Budget` column is a different quantity and is the one `--memory-cap` acts
on: peak `VmData`, the virtual size of the private writable mappings, which is
what `RLIMIT_DATA` is checked against. A port that holds an old buffer while it
fills a new one is charged for both there and for neither in peak RSS, so the two
columns can disagree by a lot -- on a 6M CSV pair the port with the second
smallest `above` needs the largest budget. Without this column the table could
not explain its own refusals. It is polled rather than taken from rusage, which
has no equivalent, so it is a floor on the true peak.

CPU seconds over wall seconds is the `cores` column: how many of this machine's
cores were actually busy. It is the column that separates "slow" from "idle" --
two ports at the same wall time and 1.2x against 3.6x cores are not the same
result, and the first one has headroom the second has already spent.

Both inputs are read once before anything is timed: a cold page cache costs more
than every difference this table is trying to show.

    of them scans: it goes to the columnar path instead, which is why the Parquet
    rows below are not measuring the scanner the CSV rows are.

    The C port is here rather than only in `bench_ports.py` so that one table can
    answer "did this change make a port slower" for every port at once. It was
    the one port this script did not build, which meant the per-pull-request
    benchmark and the leading port were in two different workflows.

    `matrix` adds the scanner builds -- SWAR against a vector register, one
    binary each so nothing is measuring a branch -- and the Rust engine without
    its report, which is the only row here that is not comparing like with like:
    the Rust port renders the HTML the other two do not produce at all.

    The Rust rows do **not** pass `--engine turbo`, and used to. The Rust port
    carries two Parquet readers, and `engine.rs` says in as many words that an
    explicit `--engine turbo` is the one thing that retires the columnar one:
    *"Only an explicit --engine turbo should do that."* So this table spent its
    life measuring the reader a user never gets. On a 500k pair the two are
    0.15s against 0.43s, and 91 MB against 263 MB above the input, for identical
    counts -- which is the whole of the Rust Parquet column in every table this
    project has published, and most of why the port could not do 50M. `auto`
    picks the columnar reader and falls through to `turbo` for a codec or a page

    CPU is user plus system for that exact child, from the same `wait4` rusage
    the RSS comes from. Wall time says how long you waited; CPU divided by wall
    says how many cores were busy while you waited, which is the difference
    between an engine that is slow and an engine that is idle. A port that
    finishes in the same wall time on half the CPU has the headroom the other
    one has already spent.

    `why` is the child's last line of stderr, which is empty on a run that
    worked and is the whole diagnosis on one that did not. It used to go to
    /dev/null with stdout, so a rung that ran out of memory reported `FAILED
    (exit 2)` and nothing else -- and the ports name what did not fit.

    The last number is peak `VmData`, and it is here because **it is the quantity
    the cap below actually bounds** and peak RSS is not. `RLIMIT_DATA` is checked
    against `mm->data_vm`, the *virtual* size of the private writable mappings --

    the mapped input among them.
