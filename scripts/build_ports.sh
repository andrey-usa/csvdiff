# Build named port targets at the same time instead of one after another.
#
# Every workflow that needs more than one port was building them serially in a
# single `run:` block, which on a four-core runner leaves three cores idle
# through most of it: a single-file `clang++` compile is one core, and three of
# those fit beside a `cargo build` that is already using what it can. Measured
# on a four-core box, `cpp`, `cpp-scanners` and `zig` together took 118.5s in a
# row and 54.0s at once -- 2.19x, for work that was always independent.
#
# Concurrency defaults to the core count rather than "all of them at once".
# Seven concurrent C++ and Rust compiles is several gigabytes of resident
# compiler, and a runner that swaps would give the time back with interest.
#

#   BUILD_JOBS=2 scripts/build_ports.sh c cpp
#
# `CXX`, `CC` and `RUSTFLAGS` are read from the environment, so a caller that
# wants clang or a target feature sets it the way it always did.
#
# Each target's output is kept and printed under its own heading when it
# finishes, because interleaved compiler errors from four builds at once are
# not readable. The exit status is non-zero if any target failed, and every
# target is run even when an earlier one fails -- one run should name all the
# broken builds, not just the first.

# Every other port is compiled for the machine it runs on: both Makefiles probe
# and add `-march=native`, and Zig's default target is already the host (a build
# with `-Dcpu=native` is byte-identical to one without). Rust was the exception.
# With no RUSTFLAGS, `cargo build --release` targets baseline x86-64 -- sse, sse2
# and fxsr, nothing else -- so every table this script produced compared an SSE2
# Rust against an AVX-512 C and C++.
#
# That is not the documented intent. README.md says "every port is compiled for
# the machine it runs on: -march=native for C and C++, -C target-cpu for Rust,
# -Dcpu=native for Zig", BENCHMARKS.md says the same of its current tables, and
# `benchmark-native.yml` sets the flag by hand. The six workflows that build
# through this script never did, and those are the ones a pull request sees.
#
# The automatic default is `x86-64-v3` rather than the host's resolved CPU, and
# it is a fixed string rather than a per-host name. Both choices are about where
# the flag lands. `-C target-cpu` reaches *every* crate cargo compiles, not just
# the csvdiff binary the tables measure -- including the proc-macro build tools
# (`proc-macro2`, behind serde's derive) whose compiled binaries then *run* on
# the runner half-way through the build. Resolving the host CPU on GitHub's VM
# fleet picked `znver4`, and one of those build tools died with SIGILL -- illegal
# instruction -- because the guest advertises AVX-512 that it cannot execute.
# Lanes that resolved `znver3` were fine, and CI (Rust), which builds without the
# flag, passed on the same SHA. C and C++ never hit this because `-march=native`
# only touches binaries that run later, on the host they were built on. Capping
# at `x86-64-v3` keeps the gain over SSE2 -- every current ubuntu-latest VM
# executes AVX2 without difficulty, the `csvdiff-avx2` build is already
# unconditional -- and stays inside what the whole fleet runs. A fixed string
# also makes cargo's fingerprint uniform across hosts, which is safe now rather
# than the trap it was with a resolved name: a `rust/target` restored from
# another machine's cache still runs here, and vice versa.
#
# An explicit RUSTFLAGS from the caller still wins, as it always did.
