"""Do the generators still write the same bytes?

Four programs write this project's benchmark data -- one per port that has a
generator, plus the Python one -- and the whole point of having four is that
they agree down to the byte. A table comparing engines is only a table about
engines if every engine read the same file.

Nothing enforced that. `parity.yml` generates *one* dataset with `c/gen-data`
and checks that every reader agrees on the counts, which is a different claim;
`c/test.sh --with-ports` compares C against C++ and stops there. So the Rust
generator and the Python one had never been byte-compared to anything in CI, and
a real divergence sat in that gap: on ndjson, where a row's `value_date` has
been blanked, C and C++ write `null` and Rust writes `""`. Every reader treats
both as absent, so no answer ever changed and nothing failed.

This is the check that would have caught it. Known divergences are named below
rather than hidden, and a named one that stops differing fails too -- otherwise
the list rots into a place where fixed bugs go to be forgotten.

  python3 scripts/generator_parity.py --rows 200k

Parquet is not compared. The generators disagree about compression defaults and
therefore about filenames -- C writes `p_a.unc.parquet` under
`--compression none` where Rust writes `p_a.parquet` -- so a byte comparison
there is a question about flags rather than about the data. Text is also where
the hazard is: a Parquet file that had gone wrong could not be read back, and
the reader checks already cover that.
