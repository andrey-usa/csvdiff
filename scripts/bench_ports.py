"""Every native port that reads the format, on one pair of files, interleaved.

The question this answers is narrow on purpose: given the same columnar design
and the same input, how much is left for the language and the toolchain? The
four ports here read Parquet through code written for this project rather than
through a library, so nothing in the table is measuring somebody else's reader.

Two things it is careful about, both of which produced wrong numbers first.

**Interleaved, not one port at a time.** This machine's speed drifts under the
runs themselves -- page cache fills, and the kernel's supply of free 2 MB pages
is picked over and replenished -- so a number taken now and one taken twenty
minutes ago are comparing machine states, not builds. Every port runs once per
round, in the same order, and the rounds are what repeat.

**Best, median and worst, not just best.** A port that is quick once and slow
twice is not quick, and the spread is where memory pressure shows up.

Peak RSS is `wait4`'s rusage for that exact child -- the kernel's own high-water
mark rather than a poll that can miss a spike. These engines map their inputs,
so resident pages include the files; the column that carries information is
`above`, which subtracts them.

A port that cannot read the pair it is given is left out by name rather than
counted as slow or as agreeing with everyone: on `main` the Rust and Zig ports
refuse newline-delimited JSON, and a table that quietly omitted them would read
as though they had not been asked.

Ports built from another checkout can be added with `CSVDIFF_PORTS_EXTRA`, a
JSON array of `[label, path, extra_flags]`. That is how a branch's port is
measured against the same rows on the same host in the same sitting, which is
the only way two builds can be compared at all -- and the counts gate below
applies to them exactly as it does to the built-in four.
