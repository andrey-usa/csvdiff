"""How do the ports scale from one core to four, and what is the serial fraction?

Both C and C++ measured ~1.7x from 1 to 4 threads while using ~3 cores of CPU.
That is a bigger prize than anything else found in the C++ gap work, and it is
not language-specific. This sweeps every thread count and fits Amdahl.
