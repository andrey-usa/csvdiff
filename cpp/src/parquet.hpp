// A Parquet reader shaped for comparing, not for querying.
//
// It reads exactly what this job needs and refuses the rest by name, which is
// the same bargain the rest of this port makes: BYTE_ARRAY columns, PLAIN and
// dictionary encodings, uncompressed or Snappy. That covers what DuckDB,
// polars and pandas write for string columns, and it is the shape the
// comparison actually meets.
//
// Two things it does that a general reader would not.
//
// It hands back *offsets into the mapped file* rather than strings. A PLAIN
// byte array is a four-byte length followed by its bytes, already contiguous
// and already in the mapping, so a value can stay an offset and a length --
// the same representation the CSV and JSON paths use, and the reason nothing
// here builds a string per cell.
//
// And it keeps dictionary columns encoded. Where a column is dictionary
// encoded, the rows are indices into a small table of distinct values, so two
// files can be compared by mapping one dictionary onto the other once and then
// comparing integers -- which is what makes the per-column diff a vector
// operation instead of a string compare per row.

// A value's bytes, as an offset and a length packed into one word: forty bits

// the same layout the CSV engine packs a field into, for the same reason --
// eight bytes a value rather than sixteen is eighty megabytes less to carry,
// and eighty megabytes less to stream past the CPU, on a ten-million-row
// column. Forty bits of offset is a terabyte; twenty-three of length is eight
// megabytes, and a longer value is refused by name rather than truncated.
//
// The offset is into the mapped file where the page was stored uncompressed,
// and into the reader's own buffer where it had to be decompressed --
// `Column::owned` says which.
