# Benchmark history

Every run this project has kept, newest first: the methodology and the latest entries
here, everything older in [docs/benchmarks/](docs/benchmarks/) (indexed at the bottom of
this file). Each entry names the host, the
date and the way it was measured, because that is what makes two numbers
comparable — and what makes numbers from two different entries **not**
comparable. Compare rows within a table. Never across tables.

Terse verdicts on things the project no longer carries are in
[ARCHIVE.md](ARCHIVE.md).

## How to read these

**One CPU per table, and CI does not give you that for free.** Every number is
only comparable with another taken on the same processor. On GitHub's hosted
fleet that is not a formality: one `ubuntu-latest` label covers several
generations, so two jobs in one workflow run can land on a Xeon Platinum 8370C
and an EPYC 7763 — different cache, different core layout, a different AVX-512
story. A ladder that runs one size per job, or a matrix that runs one format per
job, produces pieces measured on *different machines*; read as a single curve
they measure the fleet as much as the code. So `bench_formats_ports.py` records
the CPU in its JSON beside the numbers, and `scripts/bench_group.py` groups on it
and prints one table per processor, naming any rung that is missing from a group
rather than filling it in from another. A run whose summary shows two CPUs has
produced two tables, whatever it looks like.

**Interleaved, not one build at a time.** A machine's speed drifts under the
runs themselves — the page cache fills, the kernel's supply of free 2 MB pages
is picked over. Every build runs once per round and the rounds repeat. A number
taken now and one taken twenty minutes ago compare machine states, not builds.

**The starting build rotates between rounds.** In a fixed order one build is
always first into a cold page cache and one is always last, and that position
quietly becomes part of its number. Rotating the start spreads both ends over
every build instead of assigning them. It also decides who survives a run that
is killed partway: a table that always ran the ports in the same order left the
ones at the back with no measurement at all, which reads like slowness and is
not. Tables are still printed in the declared order, so two runs can be read
side by side, and each format's rows are written out as soon as they are
measured rather than at the end.

**Best, median and worst.** A build that is quick once and slow twice is not
quick, and the spread is where memory pressure shows.

**CPU is the honest measure of work.** Wall time mixes work with how many cores
the design manages to use; CPU seconds do not. Where a build wins on wall and
loses on CPU, it is winning on threading.

**Peak RSS includes the mapped input.** These engines map their files, so
resident pages include the files themselves. The column that carries
information is *above the input*, which subtracts them.

**A negative *above the input* is not a benchmark.** It is the same column read
the other way: a port that peaked *below* the bytes it mapped did not hold its
own input, because the kernel was taking pages back while it was still using
them. Every time in such a row is a page-fault ranking, not a parsing one, and
does not belong beside a rung that fit. `bench_formats_ports.py` now says so
before the rung runs -- it refuses to call a pair a benchmark once it passes
80% of the machine's RAM, leaving room for the indexes the ports build on top
-- and `bench_group.py` says so again afterwards, naming the rows that did it.
The rung still runs either way: which port degrades worst under paging is its
own kind of answer, and a number with a stated caveat beats no number.

**Counts are gated, not assumed.** Every run below ends with every build
returning identical counts. A build that disagrees fails the run and is named;
none of the tables here contains a build that was fast because it was answering
a different question.

**Same counts is not the same task.** The gate above proves the ports agree on
*what changed*. It says nothing about what else they were asked to produce, and
for most of this file's life they were not asked for the same thing. Every
harness passed `--json` to all four ports, and only the C++ port emits row
samples: C and Zig write `counts` and `columns` -- 1,196 bytes on a 4M pair --
Rust adds a `meta` block for 3,057, and C++ writes **4,917,335 bytes naming
58,600 rows**. C has no flag to turn samples on, because it has no such feature.

So `--json` cost C 39,250 instructions on a 400k pair, 0.0%, and cost C++ 808
million, 44%: it switches on a second full random-probed pass over B and then
materialises, sorts and writes every sampled row. Measured on a 4M pair at four
threads, warmed and with the two modes interleaved, **C++ is 1.81x C on the task
all four ports perform and 2.25x once C++ alone is asked for a report** -- about
a third of the published CSV gap was the report.

The timed runs no longer pass `--json`. The counts gate still needs the
document, so it gets its own untimed run first. `scripts/report_cost.py` prints
what each port's document contains beside what producing it costs, in that
order, because the shape is the reason for the cost. This is the same fault as
the `-march=native` one below, and `ports()` already fixed the matching case for
Rust by passing `-o /dev/null` so its HTML was not charged against ports that
render none; C++'s samples were the half that was missed.

**What this harness can and cannot resolve.** Measured, not assumed: running one
build against a copy of itself, where the true answer is 1.00x.

| Comparing two builds by | Same build twice reads as |
|---|---:|
| separate bests, one build's runs then the other's (hyperfine's model) | 15.8% apart, worst of eight |
| separate bests, interleaved rounds | 8.3% apart, worst of eight |
| separate bests, interleaved, 5 rounds → 15 rounds | 9.1% → **9.4%** |
| the median of the per-round paired ratios | **1.01x** |

The third row is the one that matters: three times the rounds did not help,
because what this machine does is *drift*, not jitter, and averaging does not
touch drift. Comparing the two builds *within* each round does, because the two
runs are seconds apart under one machine state. `scripts/bench_ab.sh` does that
and prints the middle half of the per-round ratios beside the median; where that
half straddles 1.00x, there is no result to report.

So: a difference under about 10% is invisible to a ratio of bests here, and
about 3% is the floor for the paired one. Ratios below those are the machine.

**Every cross-port table before the 11:23 run was built unfairly**, and is kept
rather than deleted because the numbers within each port are still that port's.
C and C++ carried `-march=native`; Rust and Zig were given a generic baseline,
which compiles their wide scanners out entirely — the Rust one is selected by
`cfg!(target_feature = "avx2")` and the Zig one by the cpu it is handed. So the
C-versus-Rust and C-versus-Zig ratios in those tables are partly build flags,
and correcting it cost about two thirds of the published C lead on CSV and on
Parquet. Every port is now built for the runner it is measured on. It was the
other branch's agent that pointed this out.

## 2026-09-28 (zig guard span) — the Zig join stopped parsing rows the proof settles

The C change from 09-27, ported to Zig. `Join.range` called `fieldsOf` on every
row of A before the byte proof; now `text.guardSpan` counts the guard column's
delimiters with the delimiter cursor alone — no slot map, no field packing —
and rows the bytes settle never parse. On the 2M CSV pair 93.8% of attempted
rows prove out, matching the 94% identical rows in the data.

One bug found by the numbers, not the compiler: the first version returned
`cur + 1 - lo`, including the delimiter in the span, the way C's does — but
Zig's `rowMatches` expects the span to end at the field boundary and checks the
*next* byte is a delimiter, so the proof never fired (`proved=0` on every
row). Corrected to `cur - lo`; the proof then succeeded on 60,526 of 64,516
attempts per thread.

`bench_ab.sh`, 2M rows CSV, `--threads 1`, 7 interleaved rounds, two binaries.
Paired ratio (baseline / guard_span): **1.10x [1.09–1.12] CPU, every quarter
above 1.00.** `--self-test` on the same machine: 1.00x [0.96–1.02] — the gain
is well above the floor. All 44 `zig/test.sh` checks pass; counts identical
(matched 1,998,000, changed 119,625, added/removed 2,000 each).

That closes the port set: guard_span now ships in C (#178), C++ (#179), Rust
and Zig. It pays where the parser is expensive (C, C++) and where the join
parsed every row regardless (Zig); Rust's parser was already cheap enough that
the counting ate the win.

Committed as `f39da04`, pushed straight to main.

## 2026-09-28 (rust and zig u32 hash slots) — the index stopped spending 64 bits per slot

Both ports kept one `u64` per hash-table slot: 40 bits of row position, the
rest hash tag. Forty position bits address a trillion rows; the largest input
this project has measured is 150M. C and C++ already sized their slots to the
row count. Rust (`9d89c95`) and Zig (`4f80fa2`) now do the same: the table is
`Vec<u32>` when 32 bits of position suffice, with the tag taking the high bits
that remain, and the build refuses rather than truncates past ~4 billion rows.

`bench_ab.sh`, 2M rows CSV, `--threads 1`, interleaved rounds, two binaries
each port. Paired ratios (baseline / u32):

- Rust: **1.04x [1.03–1.08] CPU** against a self-test floor of 1.00x [0.98–1.03]
  — at the edge of resolvability, kept for the memory: peak RSS 4,218 → 4,099
  MB (−119 MB on one side; the saving doubles at 50M).
- Zig: **1.07x [1.05–1.08] CPU** against a floor of 1.03x [0.99–1.04] — a real
  win, and larger than Rust's.

Counts identical in both ports. One bug caught before the push: Zig computed
`64 - tag_bits` into a `u6`, which cannot shift a `u32` — fixed with a guarded
`@intCast` to `u5` at every u32 shift site, `u6` kept where the shift is u64.
The bug survived this long because no local Zig toolchain existed to compile
it; CI caught nothing either, since the branch had never built Zig there.

## 2026-09-29 (parquet u32 hash slots) — the same conversion, three more ports

The CSV ports all had u32 slots by 09-28, but the Parquet ports were still on
64-bit: C `pqdiff`, C++ `pqdiff`, Rust `pqdiff`. Zig's `pqdiff` already had
u32 (`4f80fa2`) — which is why Zig led the 50M Parquet memory table in the
fourth ladder edition (6,201 MB above the input vs 6,953–7,178 MB for the
other three).

Commit `174c28f` converts all three to the adaptive u32 scheme: position bits
from the row count, hash tag in the high bits, refuse past ~4B rows. Same
pattern as the CSV conversion, same guarantee — slot width is not in the
comparison contract, so counts are identical by construction.

Tests: C 73 ok, C++ 25 ok, Rust 58 unit + 15 integration ok. No A/B on speed
yet — the local machine cannot fit a meaningful Parquet pair (2 GB free), and
the improvement is primarily memory: at 50M Parquet the slot table is ~400 MB
per side, halved by this change.

## 2026-09-29 (capped 150M re-run) — the u32 slots do not move the ceiling

Run `36512611216`, same methodology as 09-28 (`mem_cap_mb=13941` via
`RLIMIT_DATA`, 52.6 GB CSV input, 16 GB runner). All four ports pass:

- Rust: 287s / 13,655 MB (09-28: 289s / 13,881 MB)
- C: 378s / 14,045 MB (09-28: 335s / 14,106 MB)
- Zig: 341s / 14,982 MB (09-28: 343s / 15,007 MB)
- C++: 363s / 13,985 MB (09-28: 583s / 13,939 MB)

The CSV u32 slots (Rust `9d89c95`, Zig `4f80fa2`, both merged 09-28 after the
previous capped run) do not move the 150M ceiling in any meaningful way —
times and peak RSS are in the same band. Expected: under a 14 GB cap with
52 GB of input, the run is bound by page-cache eviction and I/O, not by the
slot table. The u32 win lives at 10M–50M, where the table is a real fraction
of the working set. C++'s jump from 583s to 363s is runner variability on the
09-28 sitting (a throttled runner), not a code change — C++ CSV already had
u32 slots before both runs.

A drive-by fix rode with the Rust change: `--summary` no longer builds the
pick lists it then discards (an 11 MB abort on small caps).

## 2026-09-28 (withdrawn: the C sweep gap) — a 2.5x parser lead that was not there

An earlier entry in the working notes claimed the C sweep parsed 2M CSV rows in
0.165s against 0.385–0.425s for Rust, Zig and C++ — a 2–2.5x lead, and the
obvious next target. It does not reproduce. A fresh `phases_ports.py` run on
the same machine, five rounds at one and two threads, puts all four sweeps at
0.16–0.21s. The gap was a measurement artefact, most likely machine load during
the first sitting — the numbers were never re-run before being written down.

Withdrawn in full. There is no sweep investigation to continue.

What survived the re-measurement is the join gap on larger inputs: 10M CSV,
Zig 0.433s against 0.365s for the other three (+19%). That is what the Zig
guard_span entry above addresses.

---

## 2026-09-28 (rust hoist needs_normalising) — the sweep stopped asking about options it already knew

`hash_field` is called for every key field of every row — twenty million calls
on the 10M benchmark. Each call checked `needs_normalising(opt)` twice: once
via `is_absent`, once directly. Forty million checks of four booleans that
never change mid-run. C's `hash_field` takes no `opt` at all.

`key_hash` now computes the flag once and passes it down as a `bool`. The fast
path (no normalization, the common case) checks absence directly from the field
word, skipping the `is_absent` call entirely. The normalized path is unchanged.

`bench_ab.sh`, 10M rows CSV, `--summary`, interleaved rounds, EPYC 9D64.
Paired ratio (main / hoisted): **1.03x [1.01–1.10] CPU, in every quarter of the
rounds.** The self-test floor on this machine is ~1.07x, so this is just at the
edge of resolvability — a small, consistent win, not a breakthrough. (Absolute
timings are omitted: the two arms ran in different sittings, so their wall/CPU
numbers are not comparable — only the paired ratio is valid.) Output identical
on the 10M pair; all 58 `cargo test` checks pass; `fmt` and `clippy` clean.

Merged alongside the hoist, all in `rust/src/engine/turbo.rs`, each measured
neutral on its own paired run: unchecked indexing in `Index::lookup` (1.04x
[0.96–1.07]), combined `Chunk::push` (1.00x [0.96–1.01]), and a
`same()`/`plain_absent` fast-path (0.98x [0.95–1.01]). Kept for architectural
alignment with the C port, not for speed.

Probed and rejected in the same session: removing the matched-B bitmap entirely
(10M atomic `mark` ops + 1.25MB allocation + 10M-bit walk) measured 1.01x
[0.99–1.05] — the atomics are not the bottleneck. `#[inline]` on `key_hash`
measured nothing.

The remaining gap to C (Rust ~7.5s vs C 5.3s CPU on the same 10M pair) is
architectural.
