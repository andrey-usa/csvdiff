//! The test root: every module, so `zig build test` covers all of them.

//! The readers and the decoders keep their tests beside the code they check,
//! because an off-by-one in a bit-packed group is a wrong value rather than a

//! This used to say the engine's own tests are in `csvdiff.zig`. There are none:
//! that file has no `test` block, and it is not imported here, so anything added
//! to it would not run either. What covers the engine is `test.sh` and the parity
//! workflows, which check this port's answers against the other three rather than
//! its parts against themselves. Worth knowing before trusting `zig build test`
//! to have exercised a change to the join.
