//! The bytes a field points into, and the one route every comparison reads them
//! through.
//!
//! A field is an offset and a length, so something has to say what those address
//! and how the bytes are escaped. For CSV and JSON that is the mapped file; for
//! Parquet it is an arena of decoded values, which is the same thing to everyone
//! downstream. The escape rule rides along because it follows the format: CSV
//! doubles a quote, JSON puts a backslash in front of one, and a decoded Parquet
//! value is already literal.
//!
//! Hashing, equality and decoding all read a field through `logical`, so they
//! cannot come to different conclusions about the same value — the property whose
//! absence produced two silently wrong answers in the Java port.
