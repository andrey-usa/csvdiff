/*
 * A Parquet reader for comparing, in C: uncompressed, snappy and LZ4.
 *
 * Snappy and LZ4 are written out here rather than pulled in, the same choice
 * the Zig port made and for the same reason -- each is a byte-copy loop of
 * about eighty lines, and a port whose selling point is that it carries no
 * dependency should not acquire one to read the codec every Parquet writer
 * defaults to. Gzip and zstd are not here: their decoders are real programs,
 * and writing those out would be a library in this file rather than a loop.
 * Both are refused by name.
 *
 * Two things it does that a general reader would not, both inherited from the
 * C++ design and both the reason the comparison above it can stay columnar.
 *
 * It hands back offsets rather than strings. A PLAIN byte array is a four-byte
 * length followed by its bytes, already contiguous, so a value stays an offset
 * and a length -- the same eight-byte packing the CSV engine uses for a field,
 * and the reason nothing here builds a string per cell.
 *
 * What those offsets count from is `owned` when it is non-empty and the mapping
 * when it is not. A column is wholly compressed or wholly not -- a column whose
 * chunks disagree is refused -- so that one field settles it for every slice in
 * the column, and `pq_base()` is the only place a caller has to ask. Reading an
 * uncompressed file is unchanged: `owned` stays NULL and every offset is into
 * the mapping, as it always was.
 *
 * And it keeps dictionary columns encoded, so two files can be compared by
 * mapping one dictionary onto the other once and then comparing integers.
