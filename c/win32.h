/*
 * The Win32 half of the two calls this port makes that Windows does not have:
 * a file mapping and a thread. Everything else it uses -- open, close, read,
 * write, fstat, malloc -- the Microsoft C runtime provides under the same names
 * MinGW puts in <unistd.h> and <fcntl.h>, so the rest of the port compiles as
 * written.
 *
 * This is a compatibility header, not an emulation layer: each shim covers the
 * exact shape this port calls, and no more. `mmap` here is read-only, private,
 * whole-file and offset-zero, because that is the only mmap the port asks for.
 * A shim that pretended to be general would be a lie that the next reader has
 * to disprove.
 *
 * Nothing here is compiled off Windows -- the whole file is inside the guard --
 * so a POSIX build cannot pick up a shim by accident.
