//! Parameterised composite-key CSV comparison with a self-contained HTML report.
//!
//! Two CSV files are joined on a composite key and the differing cells are
//! reported: what changed, what was added, what was removed, and which keys are
//! duplicated in either file. Nothing about a specific dataset lives in the
//! code — key columns, compared columns and normalisation are all runtime
//! parameters.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use csvdiff::{Options, compare, render};
//! use std::path::Path;
//!
//! let mut opt = Options::with_key(["order_id", "line_no"]);
//! opt.ignore = vec!["updated_at".to_string()];
//! let result = compare(Path::new("july.csv"), Path::new("august.csv"), &mut opt)?;
//! std::fs::write("report.html", render(&result, true)?)?;
//! # Ok::<(), csvdiff::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! The result contract, the report template and the exit codes are shared byte
//! for byte with the Python, TypeScript, Java and Go implementations of this
//! tool, so a report from any of them is interchangeable.
