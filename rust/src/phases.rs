//! Phase timings on stderr, when `CSVDIFF_PHASES` is set.

//! A comparison has costs that move independently: sweeping and hashing every
//! row, inserting them into the index, joining, and rendering. Knowing which one
//! grew is the difference between tuning and guessing, and the cores-busy column
//! says only *that* something is serial, never which thing.
//!
//! The same switch and the same output shape every other port uses. It lives
//! here rather than inside one engine because both of this port's paths want
//! it: the text engine had it from the start, and the columnar Parquet reader
//! was the one path in any of the four ports that could not be asked where its
//! time went.
