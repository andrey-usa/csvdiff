//! The byte-level engine: map the file, index it in place, build no string for a
//! cell unless that cell reaches the report.
//!
//! Every other in-memory engine here reads a row into owned `String`s and hashes
//! one of them into a map. On twenty columns and a million rows that is twenty
//! million allocations, and all but the few thousand the report embeds are
//! thrown away. This engine keeps a field as an offset and a length into the
//! mapped bytes; hashing and comparison read those bytes in place, and only the
//! capped report sections are ever decoded.
//!
//! That is the same design as the Java `turbo` engine and the C, C++ and Zig
//! ports, and it exists here for a specific reason: Java `turbo` beats Rust
//! `native` by nearly six times on time and four on memory, which reads as a
//! language result and is not one. With both designs in one language the
//! comparison is honest.
//!
//! Three things are layered on that base, and each is worth a sentence:
//!
//! - **Three input formats.** CSV, newline-delimited JSON and Parquet all reduce
//!   to the same field word, so the two sides of a comparison need not be in the
//!   same format: a CSV export compares against the Parquet a warehouse emits.
//!   See [`text`] and [`parquet`].
//! - **Every core.** Each file is split at row boundaries, parsed and hashed in
//!   parallel, and inserted into its index in file order; the join then splits
//!   over contiguous ranges of A's keys. Ordering is preserved where it is
//!   load-bearing, so the answer does not depend on the thread count.
//! - **Normalisation is delegated rather than reimplemented.** With `--trim`,
//!   `--ignore-case`, `--empty-is-null` or a tolerance in play a field is decoded
//!   and handed to the same [`crate::columns`] functions every other engine uses,
//!   so the answer cannot drift; without them the raw bytes are compared and
//!   hashed directly, which is the path the benchmarks take.
//!
//! Hashing and equality always read the same bytes by the same route — the
//! property whose absence produced two silently wrong answers in the Java port.
