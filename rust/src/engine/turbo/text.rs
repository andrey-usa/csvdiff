//! The two text readers: CSV, and newline-delimited JSON.
//!
//! They are one module because they are one design. A JSON value is a contiguous
//! run of bytes in the file exactly as a CSV field is, so a field stays an offset
//! and a length for both and nothing downstream has to know which format it came
//! from. What differs is how a row is walked — by column number, or by key — and
//! how a value is escaped, which [`super::slab`] settles.
//!
//! The two sides of a comparison need not agree: a CSV export compares against
//! the JSON the same pipeline emits, and the key order on each side is free to
//! differ, because the JSON reader joins by name.

/// The JSON proof, past ignored values that differ.
///
/// `a` is A's row from its start through the last value either side wants; the
/// plain proof holds when the mate opens with exactly those bytes and its tail
/// names nothing tracked. One ignored member in between whose value differs --
/// an `updated_at`, say, which differs on every row -- fails that on every row.
/// So where the two rows first differ, this finds the member of A's object that
/// byte is in. If it is the value of a name nobody tracks, the value is skipped
/// in each row on its own -- in B from the same offset, since everything before
/// it agreed, name included -- and the comparison carries on from there. A
/// difference anywhere else, in a tracked value, or in a shape the walk does not
/// follow fails the proof, and the row is parsed as before. The names before
/// each skipped value are equal bytes in both rows and the skipped values belong
/// to untracked names, so every tracked name sits at the same place with the
/// same bytes; the tail check covers what follows. The C and C++ ports have the
/// same proof (#234, #235).
