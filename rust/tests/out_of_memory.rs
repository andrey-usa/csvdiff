//! A budget that is not enough is an error, not a signal.
//!
//! The three other ports in this repository answer a memory ceiling the way they
//! answer a missing column — a line on stderr and exit 2 — and this one used to
//! answer it with `abort`, because Rust's default allocator calls
//! `handle_alloc_error` and there is no way to return from that. On the 50M-row
//! Parquet rung of the benchmark ladder that was the difference between a
//! refusal and no answer at all: C, C++ and Zig each printed what they could not
//! fit and the harness moved on, and this port died on signal 6.
//!
//! Two failures beside the abort, both worse in their way and both found by
//! walking the cap down one rung at a time:
//!
//!   * `Scope::spawn` panics when the OS will not give it a thread, which under a
//!     memory cap is exactly when it happens, because a thread's stack is a
//!     private mapping and that is what `RLIMIT_DATA` bounds. Exit 101.
//!   * printing that panic with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` set took the backtrace lock,
//!     allocated to symbolise, failed, and reached for the same lock from the
//!     allocation error hook. The process hung, which no timeout of its own ends.
//!
//! So this test asserts three things about the same run: an exit code of 2, a
//! message that says what ran out, and that it finishes at all.
//!
//! Linux only, deliberately. `RLIMIT_DATA` has covered private anonymous
//! mappings since Linux 4.7, and not file-backed ones — which is what makes it
//! the right cap for a tool that maps its input: it bounds what grows with the
//! row count and leaves the mapping alone. No other platform promises that, so
//! there is nothing to assert there.
